# FlippyPairs
This is the source code for game called FlippyPairs which can be downloaded via the Google Playstore (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.faudroids.distributedmemory).

The game is part of the "Android Challenge" where we are developing and realsing one Android app each month for one year. FlippyPairs is our app for January. Check out http://faudroids.org/ for more details.

We are always looking for feedback and ways to improve our code, so if you have something on your mind don't hesitate to drop us a note :)
